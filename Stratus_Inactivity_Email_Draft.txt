Subject: Automated Message from Stratus: inactive vm "<vm_name>"

Hello <user_name>,

VM "<vm_name>" is scheduled for shutdown in 2 days and subsequent removal in 7 days due to inactivity.
If you wish to keep this instance, sign into Stratus with your Windows credentials.
This will prevent all your instances from being shutdown or removed for another 7 days.
You wont receive this email again unless any of your instances become inactive for 7 days.

Please note that the responsibility to remove unused instance is yours,
and you should not rely on the automated system to clean them up.
This is the last email message that you will be getting for this specific instance.
