Part 1

DB Cloning allows a developer or tester to clone an entire existing source or master database to a destination clone.
New database clone is an exact copy.
The cloning operation takes about 15 minutes to clone an entire continental database.
Each team has exclusive access to their clone.
Databases are stored in separate set of filesystems located on NetApp filers.
Destination instances may be created on physical servers or VMs.
Physical servers may host multiple instances.
There are a total of 79 clone instances hosted on 8 physical servers and 33 VMs.
DB Instance is a set of processes running on a server.
Snap Manager for Oracle is a NetApp product which allows DBAs to manage clones of Oracle databases.
Unused backups are auto-purged based on retention policy.
Any *nix server with access to /tools can be used to query the DBClone back-end.
E.g.:
$ showCloneInstances -t test
.dbf files are database files.

Part 2

SMO - Snap Manager for Oracle
SMO uses NetApp client packages, snapdrive, etc.
SMO issues Snapdrive commands, OS commands, and Oracle commands.
SMO runs pre and post cloning scripts to customize db clones.
SMO requires data files, redo logs, control files, etc.
E.g.: /oradata_{SID}/db...
SMO server is running on each host which requires DB cloning.

FlexClone uses Netapp to clone file systems.

FlexVol's and FlexClones
Source FlexVol.
Volume has 5 blocks.
When a snapshot is created, it uses pointers to the original blocks.
When changes are made, it creates additional blocks which are A (orig) a' (new) for example.

For backup commands, the SMO server process on the source server:
- Saves the current state of the instance and makes copies of the control files.
- If the instance is running in archivelog mode, it either alters the state to backup mode or shuts down the instance, depending on how SMO was called.
- If the instance is not in archivelog mode, it has to be shut down to back it up.
- Calls snapdrive to take a snapshot of the file systems.
