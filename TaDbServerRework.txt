	Install SMO on TchiTaDb01 
	Decomm RDSMO3D
	Create smoketest DB's in TA02SDEV 

5. Migrate TA apps
	Stratus:
		Migrate Stratus to 11g using TA02DEV as dev environment
		Use TA02SDEV for smoketest environment
	TA Portal:
		Migrate to Oracle so it can be rehosted on our server?
		If so, use TA02DEV/TA02SDEV for dev and smoketest environments
		Delay cutover until TA02PTST is ready
	Environment website
		Can it be decomm'ed?
		
5. Migrate TA apps off of TchiAutoDb01
	Temporarily host Stratus prod on TA02SDEV 
	If env website still needs TA_CLIP@TA1TST, TA_WSM@TA1TST, and TA_WSU@TA1TST move
		them to TA02SDEV 
	Decomm TA1TST

6. Upgrade TchiAutoDb01
	Upgrade OS to OEL 5.9 (currently OEL 5.3)
	Change main IP address to 10.228 range and add backup 1GbE network link.
	Connect 1GbE primary + 1GbE backup to VLAN113 IP = 10.228.113.25. Jumbo frames enabled.

		   16 GB SGA, 2 GB PGA
		   Archivelog mode w/ tape backup

8. TA Apps prod migration
	Stratus: 
		Build UAT environment in TA02UTST
		Move prod environment from TA02SDEV to TA02PTST
	DB CLoning:
		Build UAT environment in TA02UTST
		Move prod environment from RDSMO2T & RDPROV1T (tchirdcdb03) to TA02PTST
	If TA Portal is being migrated:
		Build UAT environment in TA02UTST
		Build prod environment in TA02PTST
	

9. Misc
	Drop MET02DEV when Mike finishes with it and return disk to PATI pool
	Possibly move PCW1BLDT and/or CLIPBLDT from TchiRdcDb03 to TchiTaDb01
